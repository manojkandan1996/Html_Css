    <p>Jawaharlal Nehru[b] (14 November 1889 – 27 May 1964) was an Indian anti-colonial nationalist, secular
        humanist, social democrat,[2] and statesman who was a central figure in India during the middle of the 20th
        century. Nehru was a principal leader of the Indian nationalist movement in the 1930s and 1940s. Upon
        India's independence in 1947, he served as the country's first prime minister for 16 years.[3] Nehru
        promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science and technology during the 1950s, powerfully
        influencing India's arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, he steered India clear of the two
        blocs of the Cold War. A well-regarded author, he wrote books such as Letters from a Father to His Daughter
        (1929), An Autobiography (1936) and The Discovery of India (1946), that have been read around the world
