        aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
        Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was
        intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He was known
        as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
        technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear
        tests in 1998, the second test since the first nuclear test by India in 1974.</div>
